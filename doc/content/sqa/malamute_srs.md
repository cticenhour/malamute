!template! item key=system-scope
!! system-scope-begin

MALAMUTE performs simulations related to [!ac](AM) processes. These models often include highly coupled
systems of equations related to heat conduction, electromagnetics, Navier Stokes, mechanics, and surface
morphology, amongst others. Material models are also included to support these simulations (such as
graphite and stainless steel), and they themselves are often dependent on simulation variables: temperature,
electromagnetic field strength, stress/strain, etc. While many models within MALAMUTE are performed
at the "engineering scale" (i.e., at the scale of centimeters and meters), the [syntax/MultiApps/index.md]
can be leveraged to allow for multiscale coupling to the micro- and nano-scale of a given experiment.
This allows for not only experimental process design and evaluation at the operator level but also
evaluation of a process on the formation of a part and the experiment's end result.

In addition to modeling full experiments (like in [!ac](EFAS)), MALAMUTE also contains building blocks
for use in larger manufacturing models or as individual studies, such as directed energy deposition
and laser welding (with surface deformation and melting). Mechanics models for pressing procedures are
also under development.

!template! item key=system-purpose
!! system-purpose-begin
The purpose of MALAMUTE is to serve as a simulation platform and library for a variety of advanced
manufacturing (AM) processes and to connect the microscale characteristics and evolution of materials
with their engineering-scale, post-manufacture performance. MALAMUTE currently simulates several main
[!ac](AM) processes, including: [!ac](EFAS) (also known as [!ac](SPS)), directed energy deposition,
and surface melting. MALAMUTE's main goal is to bring together the combined multiphysics capabilities
of the [!ac](MOOSE) ecosystem to provide an open platform for future research in novel materials development
and [!ac](AM) technologies.

!template! item key=assumptions-and-dependencies
{{app}} has no constraints on hardware and software beyond those of the MOOSE framework and modules listed in their respective SRS documents, which are accessible through the links at the beginning of this document.

{{app}} provides access to a number of code objects that perform computations such as material behavior and boundary conditions. These objects each make their own physics-based assumptions, such as the units of the inputs and outputs. Those assumptions are described in the documentation for those individual objects.

!template! item key=user-characteristics
{{app}} has three main classes of users:

- +{{app}} Developers+: These are the core developers of {{app}}. They are responsible for designing, implementing, and maintaining the software, while following and enforcing its software development standards.
- +Developers+: These are scientists or engineers that modify or add capabilities to {{app}} for their own purposes, which may include research or extending its capabilities. They will typically have a background in structural or mechanical engineering, and in modeling and simulation techniques, but may have more limited background in code development using the C++ language. In many cases, these developers will be encouraged to contribute code back to {{app}}.
- +Analysts+: These are users that run {{app}} to run simulations, but do not develop code. The primary interface of these users with {{app}} is the input files that define their simulations. These users may interact with developers of the system requesting new features and reporting bugs found.

!template! item key=information-management
{{app}} as well as the core MOOSE framework in its entirety will be made publicly available on an appropriate repository hosting site. Day-to-day backups and security services will be provided by the hosting service. More information about backups of the public repository on [!ac](INL)-hosted services can be found on the following page: [sqa/github_backup.md]

!template! item key=packaging
No special requirements are needed for packaging or shipping any media containing the [!ac](MOOSE) and {{app}} source code. However, some [!ac](MOOSE)-based applications that use the {{app}} code may be export-controlled, in which case all export control restrictions must be adhered to when packaging and shipping media.

!template item key=reliability
The regression test suite will cover at least 65% of all lines of code at all times. Known
regressions will be recorded and tracked (see [#maintainability]) to an independent and
satisfactory resolution.
