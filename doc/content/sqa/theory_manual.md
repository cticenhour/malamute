# MALAMUTE Theory Manual

Background on the basis of MALAMUTE theory can be found throughout the standard user documentation.
Here, we highlight several locations of interest for MALAMUTE theory:

- Documentation for all MALAMUTE input file objects, and how they can be used in the creation of a
  multiphysics simulation, is contained in the [syntax/index.md] page.
- MALAMUTE verification and validation (V&V) cases, along with associated documentation, can be found
  in the [malamute_vvr.md].
- Documentation related to demonstration cases (which include the V&V cases mentioned above) can be
  found on the [demonstration/index.md] page.
