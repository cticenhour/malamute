## Description

This material computes the electrical conductivity, in m/$\Omega$, as the
inverse of the electrical resistivity, in $\Omega$/m, for AISI 304 stainless
steel based on the material properties given for a spark plasma sintering die in
[!citep](cincotti2007sps). This electrical material property is computed solely
as a function of temperature, T:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eqn:electrical_resistivity}
  k = 1.575 \times 10^{-15} T^3 - 3.236 \times 10^{-12} T^2 + 2.724 \times 10^{-9} T + 1.364 \times 10^{-7}
\end{equation}
with a calibration range of 296.8 to 1029K.

The relationship for this thermal material property was determined with a curve
fit to the experimental data points shown in [!citep](cincotti2007sps). As such,
the polynomial fit shown in [eqn:electrical_resistivity] does not fully  match
the curve fit relationships given in that work. The curve fit used in this class
is shown in [fig:steel_electrical_resistivity].

The local temperature is checked against the calibration range limits only once
at the start of each timestep, using the value of the temperature from the
previous converged timestep. The value of the electrical resistivity is,
however, calculated with the current value of the temperature.
