## Description

This material computes the thermal conductivity, in W/(m-K), and the specific
heat capacity, in J/(k-kg), for AT 101 graphite based on the material properties
given for a spark plasma sintering die in [!citep](cincotti2007sps). These
thermal material properties are computed only as a function of temperature, T.
The thermal conductivity is calculated as
\begin{equation}
  \label{eqn:thermal_conductivity}
  k = 1.519 \times 10^{-5} T^2 - 8.007 \times 10^{-2} T + 130.2
\end{equation}
with a calibration range of 268.9 to 3312 K.

The heat capacity calibration range is 495.5 to 4097.7K, and the relationship is
given as a piecewise function:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eqn:heat_capacity}
  C_p = \begin{cases}
    3.852 \times 10^{-7} T^3 - 1.921 \times 10^{-3} T^2 + 3.318 T + 16.282  & \text{ if } T < 2004 K  \\
    5.878 \times 10^{-2} T + 1931.166 & \text{ if } T \geq 2004 K
  \end{cases}
\end{equation}
The most conservative calibration limits are enforced within the code.

The local temperature is checked against the calibration range limits only once
at the start of each timestep, using the value of the temperature from the
previous converged timestep. The values of thermal conductivity and heat capacity
are, however, calculated with the current value of the temperature.

The relationships for these thermal material properties were determined through
curve fits to the experimental data points shown in [!citep](cincotti2007sps)
and do not completely match the curve fit relationships given in that work. The
curve fits used in this class are shown in [fig:graphite_thermal_conductivity],
[fig:graphite_lowtemp_heatcapacity], and [fig:graphite_hightemp_heatcapacity].
