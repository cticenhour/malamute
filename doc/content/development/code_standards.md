# MALAMUTE Code Standards

!style halign=left
Like MOOSE, MALAMUTE uses `clang-format` with a customized
[config file](https://github.com/idaholab/malamute/blob/devel/.clang-format)
for code formatting. If you have clang installed, you can run

```
git clang-format [<branch>]
```

to automatically format code changed between your currently checked-out branch
and `<branch>` (if left out, it defaults to the `HEAD` commit). If you don't do
this before submitting your code, don't worry! The continuous integration
testing system, [CIVET](https://civet.inl.gov), that is triggered when
you submit a pull request will check your code and provide information on the
changes needed to conform to the code style (if any).

For extended information on file guidelines, naming conventions, example code,
doxygen documentation, and other tips, please see
[the MOOSE Code Standards page](https://mooseframework.inl.gov/sqa/framework_scs.html).
