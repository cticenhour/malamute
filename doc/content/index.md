!style halign=center
MALAMUTE (MOOSE Application Library for Advanced Manufacturing UTilitiEs) is an
application for modeling advanced manufacturing processes. It is based on the
finite element method and models interactions between various coupled physics domains.
MALAMUTE is based on the MOOSE framework, and builds on the framework and modules
for many of its core capabilities.

MALAMUTE is based on [MOOSE]. It is an extremely flexible environment that permits
the solution of coupled physics problems of varying size and dimensionality. These
can be solved using computer hardware appropriate for the model size, ranging from
laptops and workstations to large high performance computers.

Code reliability is a central principle in code development, and this project
employs a well-defined development and testing strategy.  Code changes are only
merged into the repository after both a manual code review and the automated
regression test system have been completed.  The testing process and status of
MALAMUTE is available at [www.moosebuild.hpc.inl.gov](https://moosebuild.hpc.inl.gov/repo/523/).

MALAMUTE and MOOSE are developed by the Idaho National Laboratory by a team of
computer scientists and engineers and is supported by various funding agencies,
including the [United States Department of Energy](http://energy.gov).  Development
of these codes is ongoing at [INL](https://www.inl.gov) and by collaborators
throughout the world.
