# Cincotti Sample IV SPS System Electrothermal Example
# Configuration: Two stainless steel electrodes (with cooling channels) with two
#                large spacers, two small spacers, and one die-and-plungers
#                ensemble in-between. RZ, axisymmetric. Reproduces Figures 21(a)
#                and 21(b) in Cincotti reference (below)
#
# BCs:
#    Potential:
#       V (top electrode, top surface) --> Neumann condition specifiying potential
#                                          based on applied RMS Current (980 A)
#                                          and cross-sectional electrode area (see
#                                          elec_top BC below). Current turned off
#                                          at 1200 s.
#       V (bottom electrode, bottom surface) = 0 V
#       V (elsewhere) --> natural boundary conditions (no current external to circuit)
#    Temperature:
#       T (top electrode, top surface) = 293 K
#       T (bottom electrode, bottom surface) = 293 K
#       T (right side) --> simple radiative BC into black body at 293 K
#       T (water channel) --> simple convective BC into "water" with heat transfer coefficient parameter from Cincotti and temperature of 293 K
#       T (elsewhere) --> natural boundary conditions
# Interface Conditions:
#       V (SS-G upper and G-SS lower interface) --> ElectrostaticContactCondition
#       T (SS-G upper and G-SS lower interface) --> ThermalContactCondition
# Initial Conditions:
#       V = default (0 V)
#       T = 293 K
# Applied Mechanical Load: 3.5 kN
