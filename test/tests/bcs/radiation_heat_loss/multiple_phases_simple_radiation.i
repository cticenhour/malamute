# This is a simple 3D test of the simplistic radiation heat transfer loss. The
# body to which the heat is lost is considered as a pure blackbody.
# A rectangular prism is set to a uniform temperature, 400K, while the absolute
# temperature of the surrounding assumed blackbody is set to 293K. The emissivity
# is assumed to be 0.95 for 0.4 of the body and 0.07 for the remaining 0.6 of the
# body. A high thermal conductivity is used to obtain a nearly uniform temperature
# through the body needed to match to analytical solution. The heat flux loss
# through the right boundary with this radiative heat transfer boundary condition
# is calculated.
#
# The analytical solution is:
# Q = \sum_i (\alpha_i \epsilon_i * \sigma * (T^4_{body} - T^4_{infinity}))
#   = 0.4 * 0.95 * 5.67e-8 * (400^4 - 293^4) + 0.6 * 0.07 * 5.67e-8 * (400^4 - 293^4)
#   = 436.1953 W
